## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Understanding COVID-19 Trends in the United States: Data Analysis and Forecasting

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Does analyzing COVID-19 data from different states and territories in the US help us understand trends, forecast outcomes, and inform public health policies effectively?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The objective of this study is to forecast results and identify patterns by analyzing COVID-19 data from various US states and territories. We hope to provide light on the virus's transmission, the efficacy of testing and containment strategies, and the effects on healthcare systems by examining data on cases, testing, hospitalizations, and outcomes. The investigation will concentrate on locating hotspots, trends, and potential areas for further assistance. Community interventions, resource allocation, and public health policy can all benefit from this approach. Data on COVID-19 testing, cases, hospitalizations, and outcomes are gathered and published by the COVID Tracking Project from a number of US states and territories. Every day, the data is updated with new information about hospitalizations, deaths, total tests, new tests, and total cases.

## Datasources
